# MRI/CT Scan Diagnosis Website

This project enables users to upload their MRI/CT scan images, which are then analyzed by an AI model to provide a diagnosis. The goal is to assist users in understanding their scans by leveraging artificial intelligence, offering preliminary results that can guide further consultation with medical professionals.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload MRI/CT scan images in common formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .dcm).
- **AI-based Diagnosis:** The AI model processes the image to provide diagnostic insights.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive front-end to easily upload images and view results.
- **Privacy Focused:** Images are processed securely, ensuring no personal data is stored.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (AI Model)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- SQLite/PostgreSQL (Database support)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mri-ct-scan-diagnosis.git
cd mri-ct-scan-diagnosis
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Apply database migrations:**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

4. **Start the development server:**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the website.
2. Upload an MRI/CT scan image using the provided form.
3. Wait as the AI model processes the image and provides a diagnosis.
4. View the diagnosis results on the screen.

## AI Model

- The AI model used for diagnosis is based on machine learning and deep learning techniques, primarily utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- The model has been trained on a variety of medical images, enabling it to recognize patterns associated with common conditions seen in MRI/CT scans.
- The results generated are for informational purposes and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.
